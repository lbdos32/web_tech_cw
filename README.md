# The Brief 

The aim of this coursework is to design, implement, and evaluate a web application on a topic of my choosing. By doing this I will be showcasing my knowledge of server-side Web development and my mastery of the Python Flask microframework.  

In this section of the coursework, I will develop an idea for my web-app by conducting research for and creating a plan for my web-app. 

## Context:  

I will be creating a web-app for the University of Edinburgh Wild Swimming Society, called Blue Tits. They are a large society with 500+ members who gather for weekly swims in nature. They have regular Sunday Swims at 11am at a variety of locations. Some examples include; Portobello beach, Wardie Bay or Granton Harbour. They also host multi-day trips away for example, to Isle of Arran or Glencoe. 

## The Problem: 

Currently there is no central location of communication for the society. 

Some of the main things the society needs to broadcast to its members is  

- Weekly swim locations 
- Health and Safety  
- Social events 
- Trips information 

Whilst all the information you would need to navigate Blue Tits is available, it is spread across multiple locations such as: 

- The Edinburgh University Student Association page 
- The Instagram page 
- The WhatsApp group chat.  

They announce weekly swim locations on Instagram and have WhatsApp groups for other socials/events. As a member of the society, I often feel out of the loop and find that it is hard to keep track of what is going on, future and present. 

## The Solution: 

The solution I am proposing in this coursework brief is to create a web-app that, at its core, will centralise the key information for Blue Tits. To extend it further, I would like to let users post on the site and use it as a platform to blog and discuss all things wild swimming. 

In a highly aspirational world, I would love to create a simple Blue Tits mini game to be played and hosted on the website. Such as a Pacman clone but you are on the beach, and the ghosts are litter or dog poo. 

## Aims of project: 

- Provide a platform for new students to find out more about Blue Tits and enquire about membership/taster sessions. 
- Centralise communication so members can stay informed on society activities. 
- Display key health and safety information such as cold-water swimming advice and risk assessments. 
- Let members post about their swims.
